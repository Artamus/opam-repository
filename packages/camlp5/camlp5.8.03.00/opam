description: """
Camlp5 is a preprocessor and pretty-printer for OCaml programs. It also provides parsing and printing tools.

As a preprocessor, it allows to:

extend the syntax of OCaml,
redefine the whole syntax of the language.
As a pretty printer, it allows to:

display OCaml programs in an elegant way,
convert from one syntax to another,
check the results of syntax extensions.
Camlp5 also provides some parsing and pretty printing tools:

extensible grammars
extensible printers
stream parsers and lexers

It works as a shell command and can also be used in the OCaml toplevel."""
